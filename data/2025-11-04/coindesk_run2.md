## Bitcoin Plunges Below $100K for First Time Since June as Crypto Correction Worsens



### The largest crypto has now tumbled more than 20% since hitting a record high above $126,000 only one month ago.


- Bitcoin fell below $100,000, marking its weakest price since late June amid a broader market correction.

- The largest crypto has now declined over 20% from its record high above $126,000 reached on October 6.

BitcoinBTC$100,693.53fell below the $100,000 level on Tuesday on at least some major exchanges — Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken, to name three — its weakest price since late June in a broader crypto market correction. The move below that price was met with at least a bit of buying, though, with BTC bouncing back to $101,300 within minutes.

The largest cryptocurrency now has declined more than 20% from its record high above $126,000, hit just one month ago. It also made a new low below the crypto flash crash on October 10, which ranked as possibly the largest liquidation events in crypto history, taking BTC to $103,000 from above $120,000 in less than a day.

In the following weeks, recovery attempts fizzled out as bounces above $110,000 met with quick selloffs.

Among the more recent catalysts for the selling is the Federal Reserve's surprise hawkishness last week, with Jerome Powell and a growing number of his cohorts cooling expectations for another interest rate cut in December.

Bitcoin's price struggles of late have been particularly frustrating for bulls as they've come alongside continued record-setting rallies in stocks and — until recently — gold. Today is notable, though, in that assets are selling off across the board, with the Nasdaq lower by 2% and gold off 1.6%.

Not correlated on the way up, but perfectly correlated on the way down. It's been a rough autumn for bitcoin.

Paul Howard, director at crypto trading firm Wincent, said the summer’s strong demand from ETF investors and digital asset treasuries (DATs) has faded, replaced by long-term wallets offloading their holdings.

"Consensus would indicate we are in what could become a bear market aligning to bitcoin's much lauded 4-year cycle," he said. Still, he noted that if BTC manages to hold above $100,000, the market could avoid widespread panic selling and deeper liquidations.

Gary O’Shea, head of global market insights at asset manager Hashdex, cited a combination of macro pressures — the possibility of the Fed not cutting rates this year, concerns about tariffs, credit markets and equity market valuations — as drivers of the current downturn. Still, he stressed that the long-term outlook remains positive.

"We do not view today’s price action as a sign of a weakening long-term investment case for bitcoin," he said. With institutional adoption accelerating, O’Shea argued that BTC could still climb a new all-time high in the coming months.

Ripple's Stablecoin Hits $1B Milestone; Company President Discusses M&A Strategy to Fuel Growth

The U.S. dollar stablecoin of the blockchain firm climbs the ranks faster than most, tapping into its global payments network to accelerate adoption.

- Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin has surpassed $1 billion in market cap less than a year after its December 2024 launch.

- RLUSD is now the 10th largest U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, with supply split between Ethereum and the XRP Ledger.

- Ripple President Monica Long attributes the token’s rapid growth to rising institutional demand, expanding payment flows, and recent acquisitions.

## Appeals Court Seems Unmoved by Sam Bankman-Fried’s Claims of an Unfair Trial



### The former FTX CEO, who is currently serving a 25-year sentence for fraud, has repeatedly claimed that the crypto exchange was solvent at the time of its bankruptcy.


- Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's appeal for a new trial was met with skepticism from appellate judges on Tuesday.

- Bankman-Fried's defense attorney Alexandra Shapiro argued that he was not allowed to present evidence of FTX's solvency and the involvement of lawyers, impacting the outcome of his case.

- Prosecutors maintain that overwhelming evidence of fraud was presented at trial.

NEW YORK — Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s chances of getting a fresh trial seem to be dwindling, judging by the pointed questions of an appellate court during a hearing in Manhattan on Tuesday.

Bankman-Fried’s lawyer Alexandra Shapiro told the trio of Second Circuit judges that the high-profile trial was “fundamentally unfair” because her client was prevented by District Judge Lewis Kaplan from telling the jury his side of the story, or presenting the 17 jurors with “objective evidence” that FTX was, in fact, solvent at the time it filed for bankruptcy following its spectacular collapse in November 2022.

Bankman-Fried’s push for a new trial largely hinges on his long-standing argument that, because the majority of FTX creditors were made whole in the ongoing bankruptcy process — which has heavily relied on the sale of illiquid assets including real estate and venture capital investments — that there was, in fact, no actual theft.

During Shapiro’s presentation, the appellate judges repeatedly cut in to question her arguments.

“There’s a right to present evidence as to his intent, absolutely, but I don’t understand what you’re saying about there [being] objective corroboration, when the objective corroboration seems to be that, well, after the bankruptcy, more money was made,” said Circuit Judge Eunice Lee.

When Shapiro responded saying that it was clear at the time of the bankruptcy that there were “very valuable assets in the FTX estate that corroborated Mr. Bankman-Fried’s view that the [FTX and Alameda Research] were solvent,” another judge, Circuit Judge Maria Araújo Kahn, pushed back, saying:

“But [Bankman-Fried’s] misrepresentations were not to solvency, but liquidity … part of the government's theory of the case is that the defendant misrepresented to investors that their money was safe, was not being used in the way that it was the government claims and the jury convicted it was, in fact, used. So it wasn't an issue of solvency, right? It was an issue of liquidity, whether they could get their money if they asked for it.”

Judge Kahn pointed out that a recent Supreme Court decision, Kousisis v. United States, found that fraudneed not necessarily result in economic lossto be considered fraud.

Shapiro also attempted to argue that Bankman-Fried’s trial was unfair because he was not allowed to sufficiently argue his position that he was essentially led astray by FTX’s lawyers. Though Shapiro said that Bankman-Fried was not technically relying on an advice-of-counsel defense (in which the defendant claims that they cannot be held liable for fraud because they acted in good faith and relied on the advice of lawyers), he was legally entitled to “present a defense based on the involvement of lawyers, whether or not he is claiming to have specifically relied on their advice.”

“It’s evidence of good faith, and [Bankman-Fried] was entitled to present that the judge rejected his ability to present evidence about, for example, the formation of the North Dimension entities,” Shapiro added. North Dimension, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alameda Research, was the entity that controlled the bank accounts where FTX customers were told to wire money in order to trade on the exchange.

“How is that relevant to any of the counts in the indictment?” interrupted Circuit Judge Barrington Parker. “The fact that an attorney drafted a certificate of incorporation or drafted an agreement between two of the subsidiaries —help me understand how that is evidence relevant to any of the counts?”

Shapiro urged the court to consider the “cumulative picture” of Bankman-Fried’s decision-making.

“The government claimed these entities were set up to take customer money so that the defendant could use it as he pleased,” Shapiro said. “So the fact that lawyers were involved in creating the entities, lawyers were involved in drafting the contract whereby the funds were deposited in those bank accounts for the benefit of FTX customers — of course, that's all relevant to the defendant's good faith.”

While both Judges Lee and Parker acknowledged that there was “some relevance” to the involvement of FTX lawyers, they pointed out that Bankman-Fried specifically chose not to advance an advice-of-counsel defense.

“If you had advanced the advice-of-counsel defense, a lot of this stuff, I agree, would have been much more probative, but you gave that up, and you just have this vague, you know, ‘there were attorneys out there somewhere,’ defense,” Parker said, adding that he wasn’t clear how it was evidence of Bankman-Fried’s supposed “good faith” that FTX had lawyers on staff.

“Are you seriously suggesting to us that if your client had been able to

testify about the role that attorneys played in creating these various documents, the ‘not guilties’ would have rolled in?” Parker asked.

Shapiro said that Bankman-Fried’s inability to tell the jury about his lawyers’ involvement, combined with what she described as Judge Kaplan’s "asymmetric rulings on loss,” had a cumulative effect on the trial outcome.

Parker pushed back, saying: “This was a high profile trial, both sides represented by able counsel. There was the usual back and forth and aggressive up-to-the-line advocacy. You won some things, you lost some things. And, I mean, it almost seems at times that you're spending more ink on Judge Kaplan than you are on the

“I don’t agree at all, your Honor,” Shapiro said.


### Prosecutors push back


Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathan Rehn, one of lead prosecutors in Bankman-Fried’s original trial, told the appellate court that the jury had been presented with "overwhelming evidence” that the former FTX CEO had committed a large-scale fraud on the exchange’s customers.

“None of the claims that Bankman-Fried raises on appeal provide any basis to overturn the conviction in this case, especially in light of the overwhelming evidence that was presented at trial," he said.

Rehn argued that what Judge Kaplan prevented Bankman-Fried from testifying about at trial was the present-day value of certain investments that Bankman-Fried had directed to be made with customer money.

“As this court has affirmed for decades, evidence about the potential ultimate recovery for victims or the defendant’s belief in the potential ultimate recovery for victims is simply not a defense to fraud,” Rehn said. “The government didn't make the argument that the money was gone forever. The government's arguments were focused on the crisis that consumed FTX in 2022 when, in fact, the money had been misappropriated when customers were seeking to make the withdrawals that they had been assured by FTX they would be able to make, and that would be available to them, and they weren't able to do so.”

Judge Parker asked Rehn to comment on Shapiro’s claim that Judge Kaplan was biased in favor of the prosecution. Rehn denied the allegations, saying that many of the defense’s arguments at trial were “meritless, and so the court appropriately ruled against the defense on those.”“Even if there had been any error, and we submit there wasn't … this is a case if ever there was one where any error would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,” Rehn added. “There were four people who knew about the misappropriation of customer deposits. Three of them testified that they conspired with Sam Bankman-Fried to do that fraudulently. Everybody else testified that they had no idea because they had relied on Sam Bankman-Fried's representations that that wasn't what was happening inside of FTX, and there was abundant documentary evidence to support that, in addition to that overwhelming witness testimony. So the suggestion that any of these errors might have led to a different result at this trial simply can't be sustained on this record.”

The panel did not make a ruling during Tuesday's hearing. Appeals court rulings may sometimes publish months after the hearings themselves.

Coinbase Faces Flak from Traditional Bankers on Its Push for Trust Bank Charter

One of the biggest advocacy groups for banking in the U.S. has asked the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to dismiss Coinbase's licensing effort.

- Coinbase's application for a U.S. federal trust charter drew an objection from the Independent Community Bankers of America, a bank lobbying group.

- Other firms seeking licenses saw a similar pushback last week from the Wall Street advocacy organization, the Bank Policy Institute.

- The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that issues such charters is now run by a comptroller picked by pro-crypto President Donald Trump.

## 📌 Article 4: XRP Ledger’s Dual Utility Could Make It a Breakout ETF Play, Experts Argue

## XRP Ledger’s Dual Utility Could Make It a Breakout ETF Play, Experts Argue



### Ripple’s unified system for payments and wealth storage may give XRP an edge with institutions eyeing real-world utility beyond speculation, said Bitnomial CEO Luke Hoersten.


- Bitnomial CEO Luke Hoersten said XRP’s ability to support both payments and asset storage on a single ledger gives it a structural advantage as an ETF asset.

- Bitwise and Canary Capital have filed “no-delay” amendments that could allow spot XRP ETFs to launch as early as mid-November.

- Analysts and issuers believe XRP’s real-world utility and strong investor base could help its ETF outperform others in the next crypto investment cycle.

NEW YORK — The XRP Ledger’s ability to support both value transfer and real-world payments from a single platform could give it a structural advantage in the growing crypto ETF market, according to derivatives exchange Bitnomial founder and CEO Luke Hoersten.

“What I think is unique about XRP and RLUSD is you have a single ledger that is driving a two-prong strategy, one of wealth storage and transfer in XRP, and the other is in RLUSD, which is payments,” Hoersten said at Ripple’s Swell conference in New York on Tuesday. “Having that both on a single ledger with a single strategy, to me, is what makes the ecosystem unique.”

The comments came during a panel discussion alongside Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg and Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The group discussed what a spot XRP ETF could look like, and why they think it might outperform past crypto ETF launches.

McClurg explained how new SEC rules, combined with existing futures activity, now allow ETF issuers to file what’s called a “no-delay amendment” for assets like XRP.

“So for instance, we filed that for Litecoin and HBAR, you know, several weeks ago, which both of those went live last week,” McClurg said. “And then we filed an XRP ETF with no delay amendment, essentially, 20 days before November 13.”

That means a spot XRP ETF could go live as early as next week.

Bitwise, which recently launched a Solana staking ETF, is also in the race. That fund, BSOL, brought in $500 million in its first week — one of the strongest performances of any ETF in 2024. Horsley said he believes XRP could be next.

“I think XRP, and we know from our client base, is one of the highest conviction assets amongst investors, so I think it will do fabulously well, and we’ll bring it to market across all those investor types to make sure it has its best shot at making a dent,” he said.

Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, echoed that view. He compared the ETF launch race to a “Cannonball Run,” and said XRP has already proven its popularity in past crypto fund launches.

“It wouldn’t surprise me if XRP ends up being the breakout ETF of the next cycle,” Balchunas said.

Still, the panel cautioned that an ETF alone doesn’t guarantee a price surge. But as new tools like in-kind creation, physically settled futures and tighter spreads come into play, XRP may be better positioned than most to benefit from a broader shift of crypto into regulated finance.

Bitcoin Plunges Below $100K for First Time Since June as Crypto Correction Worsens
